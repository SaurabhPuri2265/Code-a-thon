Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length; 
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) { 
            int key = arr[i]; 
            int j = i - 1; 
  
            /* Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are 
               greater than key, to one position ahead 
               of their current position */
            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) { 
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]; 
                j = j - 1; 
            } 
            arr[j + 1] = key; 
        } 
    }
}
